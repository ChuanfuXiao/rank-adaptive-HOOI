greedy-HOSVD: an algorithm based on t-HOSVD with a greedy strategy to search the truncation from (1,1,...,1) proposed by Ehrlacher et al. in 2020.
rank-adaptive HOOI (RA-HOOI): our proposed algorithm based on HOOI
randomized rank-adaptive HOOI: a randomized version of RA-HOOI that uses the power iteration method to replace the truncated SVD during the iterations
